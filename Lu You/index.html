        <p><span class="drop-cap">L</span>u You was born on November 13, 1125, in a boat in the Wei River<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>during a rainy morning. China was divided, with the Northern Song dynasty invaded by the Jurchens<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>of the Jin dynasty. Despite the Southern Song dynasty's resistance in the south, the threat of invasion from the north persisted throughout Lu You's life. Known for his irredentist patriotic poems, he aimed to expel the foreign Jurchen and reunify China under the Song dynasty.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></p>
        <p><br>After the Jin dynasty conquered the Northern Song capital a year after Lu You's birth, his family fled to the south.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>Despite the turmoil, he received a good education and was raised with a strong sense of patriotism. Lu You married his cousin Tang Wan at 20, but they divorced due to his mother's disapproval and her desire for him to focus on saving the Song dynasty. His dissatisfaction over the divorce was evident when he encountered Tang Wan years later, leading to the creation of the famous poem <span class="italicize">Phoenix Hairpin</span>.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>
        <p><br>Lu You pursued an official career but faced challenges due to his anti-Jin stance. His success in civil service exams led to conflicts, and he was dismissed for advocating against the Jin dynasty. Despite multiple promotions and demotions, he retired in 1190 and spent the last two decades of his life in seclusion.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>Lu You, a fervent supporter of resisting the Jin dynasty, died on January 26, 1210, at the age of 86, with his regret being the ongoing foreign control of northern China.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></p>
        <p><br>Lu You was an incredibly prolific poet, composing around eleven thousand poems in both the shi (詩) and ci (詞) forms, along with several prose works. This extensive body of work positions him as the poet with the highest number of poems before the 15th century.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup>Despite the impact on his official career, his poetry consistently expresses his convictions, advocating for the reconquest of the north.</p>
        <p><br>The themes of his poetry are diverse. Some works echo the sentiments of Du Fu, showcasing a continuation of a poetic legacy. Another set of poems explores country life and the passage of time, drawing comparisons to the styles of Bai Juyi and Tao Qian,<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup>as noted by Watson.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></p>
        <p><br>Lu You's poetic style evolves across three distinct periods, reflecting changes in his life, experiences, and the socio-political context.<sup><a class = "footnotes" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup>His extensive contribution to Chinese poetry places him at the forefront of literary figures with a significant impact before the 15th century.</p>
        <p><br>Lu You authored numerous poems, with To My Son (示兒) standing out as one of his most renowned works. Notably, he penned this final poem as he approached the end of his life. My late great-grandfather held a special affection for this particular poem, most likely because of his connection with the warcry generation, having directly experienced the Vietnam War. While I never had the chance to meet my great-grandfather in person, I learned about his admiration for the poem through my grandfather's vivid descriptions, “What this poem means is that he does not mind not being able to take anything with him when he dies, but he is upset to see that China is still not united as a nation. He is telling his son that if this day ever comes, his family must not forget to go to his grave and tell him there.”</p>
